# 0x0A. Configuration Management

## Description
This project focuses on configuration management using Puppet. You'll learn to automate various tasks such as file creation, package installation, and process management in an infrastructure environment.

## Background Context
When I was working for SlideShare, I worked on an auto-remediation tool called Skynet that monitored, scaled, and fixed Cloud infrastructure. I used a parallel job-execution system called MCollective, which allowed me to execute commands on one or multiple servers at the same time. One day, due to a bug in my code, I accidentally sent a command to terminate all servers instead of a selected few. This resulted in shutting down 75% of SlideShare's document conversion environment. Thanks to Puppet, we were able to restore our infrastructure to normal operation in under an hour, which would have been much longer if done manually.
