So, it's a fact taht Julius Ceasar was a great man during his time, but who would we say is a great man in our present time?
I know we have man great men and women, like the great Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, my humble self, Ryan Reynolds, Leo Messi, Pep Guardiola and a host of other.
But we know for a fact that we have just one GOAT, and that man is Christiano Ronaldo. He is my absolute GOAT in the world of football.
How? Well, that I caannot explain. It is just something you know in your gut. 
Phew! I need to move on to the next task!
Hard things won't do themselves, I gotta do them!
Hard things won't do themselves, I gotta do them!
