0x07. Networking basics #0
Description
In this project, we delve into fundamental concepts of computer networking, focusing on topics such as the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP/UDP protocols, and more. By understanding these basics, we can comprehend how data is transmitted and communicated across networks.


Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

OSI Model
LAN, WAN, and Internet networks
IP addresses: types, usage, and formats
TCP and UDP protocols
Differences between TCP and UDP
Importance of TCP/UDP ports
ICMP and its role in network diagnostics

Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All Bash script files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All files should end with a new line
A README.md file is mandatory
All Bash script files must be executable
Your Bash scripts must pass shellcheck without any error
The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing
