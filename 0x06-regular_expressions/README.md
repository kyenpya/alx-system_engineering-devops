0x06. Regular expression
Description
In this project, we explore the concept of regular expressions (regex) and utilize the Oniguruma library to build regex patterns. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and text processing, widely used in various programming languages and applications.

Concepts
Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They are commonly used for tasks such as string validation, searching, and replacing substrings. The Oniguruma library, used in this project, is a regular expression engine that provides advanced pattern matching capabilities, compatible with Ruby.

Tasks
0. Simply matching School
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method. The regular expression must match the word "School".

1. Repetition Token #0
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method. The regular expression must match the pattern "hb" followed by 2 to 5 instances of the letter "t", and then the letter "n".

2. Repetition Token #1
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method. The regular expression must match the pattern "ht" followed by 1 or more instances of the letter "n".

3. Repetition Token #2
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method. The regular expression must match the pattern "hbt" followed by any number of occurrences of the letters "n".

4. Repetition Token #3
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method. The regular expression must match the pattern "hbn" followed by any number of occurrences of the letter "b", but the regex should not contain square brackets.

5. Not quite HBTN yet
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method. The regular expression must exactly match a string that starts with "h", ends with "n", and can have any single character in between.

6. Call me maybe
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method. The regular expression must match a 10-digit phone number.

7. OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method. The regular expression must match only capital letters.
