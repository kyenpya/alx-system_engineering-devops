## About
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum, focusing on foundational concepts such as loops, conditions, and parsing using Bash scripting.

## Background Context
The project aims to reinforce understanding and practical application of Bash scripting concepts, including loops, conditions, and parsing, within the context of system engineering and DevOps.

## Resources
- [Loops sample](https://example.com/loops-sample)
- [Variable assignment and arithmetic](https://example.com/variable-assignment)
- [Comparison operators](https://example.com/comparison-operators)
- [File test operators](https://example.com/file-test-operators)
- [Make your scripts portable](https://example.com/portable-scripts)
- `man` or `help` commands for:
  - `env`
  - `cut`
  - `for`
  - `while`
  - `until`
  - `if`

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, participants are expected to:
- Understand how to create SSH keys and manage servers securely.
- Learn the advantages of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`.
- Gain proficiency in using various loop and condition statements (`while`, `until`, `for`, `if`, `else`, `elif`, `case`).
- Familiarize themselves with essential Bash commands like `cut` for text processing.
- Master the usage of comparison operators and file test operators in Bash scripting.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All scripts must be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Scripts should end with a new line
- `README.md` file is mandatory
- Bash script files must be executable
- Do not use `awk`
- All Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any error
- First line of all Bash scripts must be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose
